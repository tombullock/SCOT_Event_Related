# SCOT_Event_Related

This repository contains a modified version of the SCOT pipeline (https://github.com/caitgregory/SCOT) that can visualize and output event codes and their timestamps, as well as BP and respiration data.

See Jupyter Notebook cells for instructions.  Need to make proper README file.
